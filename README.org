* Emacs configuration
This is my Emacs configuration

** Using
Clone the repo and copy the content into your emacs directory (Backup
your existing config before). For example if you using an Emacs
version >= 27
#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone https://gitlab.com/flexw/emacs-config ~/.config/emacs
#+END_SRC
Then change into the directory
#+BEGIN_SRC
cd ~/.config/emacs
#+END_SRC
and create a file
#+BEGIN_SRC
touch .emacs-custom.el
#+END_SRC
In this file custom will save its variables.

You may need some extra programs to get everything working (look
through comments in the code).
